# Showcasing Advancements In Technology
Augmented Reality application for Oregon State University Engineering Expo


The goal of this project is to showcase new and emerging technologies, this year we will be working on showcasing Augmented Reality through an iOS application. Specifically iOS since there is a greater advancement in the librarys available for development and the wider availability of tools we can use to develop the AR app.

This app will help attendees of the Engineering Expo have a more interactive experience through AR. The app for this round of development will focus on creating the functionality for overlaying a teams video ontop of thier posters. Meaning that a team will upload an image of their poster to our site (being developed seperately by the online postbac team) and they will also upload their teams video along with it.

The job of our project is to create the app that will allow for a user to use their camera to point at a teams poster at the expo and pull up that teams video by overlaying the video on the poster in AR so they can easily view it through the application.

Design considerations:
  - There is the option of having the app recognize the image and link out to a third party application (like YouTube) and have it open that third party app (YouTube) and play the video that way, but that is not taking advantage of Augmented Reality. We wanted to make sure that we were working within the design requirements and thus have chosen to persue the video overlay. This will allow a user to stay within the app and view the video as if it was infront of their camera lens to enhance and elevate the user experience.

Development considerations:
  - There was questions about crossplatrom compatibility. The best solution we found was developing in iOS since there were more packages and tools for developmetn of the application. We were able to find more established tools for wireframing and developing our application in iOS though it limits not only our users, but also our ability to develop (since not everyone has a mac for programming in swift).


## H2 Video
The AR application will use image recognition to identify posters and overlay that teams videos. This is the main goal of our project this term.

## H2 Map
There will be a map feature that will allow attendees to locate project teams. This is for later development if we can get to it.

## H2 Team Members
The AR app will also allow users to view more information about each groups team members. This is for later development if we can get to it.
